### What I learned

During this coding challenge, I gained valuable experience in several key areas:

**Express.js**: I learned to work with Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, to set up a server, handle routes, and serve static files.
**Theme Switcher Implementation**: I implemented a theme switcher that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes, enhancing user experience.
**Search and Filters**: I developed a search and filtering functionality to dynamically display data based on user input, improving the usability and interactivity of the application.

### Continued development

In the future, I will focus on several key areas for improvement:

**Data Accuracy**: I will ensure the data provided is more accurate and up-to-date.
**Enhanced Search and Filters**: I will work on improving the search and filtering functionalities to provide more precise and relevant results.
**Responsive Design**: I will prioritize making the design more responsive to ensure a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
